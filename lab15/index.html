<h1> Fancy CSS prt.1</h1>

<h2> CHALLENGE </h2>
	<p>	The challenge for lab 15 was to at least be able to create at least one example
	 		of each of the following, adding html elements as needed. Here are the following
			CSS rules we are creating:</p>
	<li> text-shadow </li>
	<li> box-shadow </li>
	<li> gradient </li>
	<li> filters </li>
	<li> rounded corners </li>
	<li> object-fit </li>
	<li> transform </li>

<div id="content">
			<img src="img/fairygirl.jpeg" alt="image"/>
</div>

<h2> PROBLEMS </h2>
	<p> The only problems I had ran into was the running the CSS's in my browser and not
			working but it was easy mistakes that I was able to catch like putting the semicolon
			at the end. I did have a little issue with trying to make the background look gradient.
			I wasn't sure where to place it in my CSS but I messed around with inputing it and figured
			it out. Other than that I was mostly just testing things out and making sure that everything
			worked properly and setting things to my liking.</p>

<h2> RESULTS </h2>
	<p> By inputing those rules into CSS I was able to get this as my webpage.</p>

<nav class=home-link>
			<a href="../index.html">Return to Homepage</a>
</nav>
</body>
