	<title>Lab 6 - More Complicated</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="lab.css" href="css/index.css"
	<h2> Objective:</h2>
	<p> The purpose of the lab was to learn about class and IDs. There can be
		multiple classes but one id. Also learned about block and inline where block
	 starts on a new line and takes as much space going from left to right. Compared
	 to inline starts does not start on a new line and contains in what is necessary.
	 We also learned how to create forms and different inputs like input,select, and
	 textarea</p>

	 <h2>Difficulties</h2>
	 <p> One issue we ran into was trying to get our schedule to aline just because
		 we were both busy, but finally found time. We got stuck on task two.
