	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure </h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p>The goal to this lab was to create a struture with Atom. Creating folders 7-10
		and having them organized and easily accesable. Also being able to reflect on this
	lab and seeing if we are making sense of the work we are doing.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p1>The two main challenges for me was adding an image to my lab 3 file. Another one
	was inserting the bullet part of the lab, but with the help of Ari I have a better
understanding on how to do both things.</p1>
