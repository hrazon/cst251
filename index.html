		<p>I am a free soul and enjoy doing anything even if it's nothing. I like being alone and listening to music
		but I also enjoy being with company. If it were up to me I would be on the beach every
single day eating hot cheetos and sandwhiches. One day I want to buy my own hippie van, dec it out and travel the whole
U.S. for a year, it's one of the things I always wanted to do ever since I was five years old. My mom always said I was
a hippie in my past life and she isn't wrong. I love writing in my journal, reading on how to be a better me and exploring
new spots to write/read at. </p>
