		<h2> Subject </h2>
			<p> The purpose of this lab is to still utilize the CSS rules from previous
				labs and continue building on those. With an addition of different divs
				like the following:</p>
				<li> Surround your page content with a div id="content"</li>
				<li> Create div id="floated" and add sample text</li>
				<li> Create div id="center-horz" with more sample text</li>
				<li> Create div id="center-img" and add a small image</li>
				<li> Create div id="center-both" and add another small image</li>

				<div>
					<img src="img/astro.jpeg" alt="astro" class=center>
				</div>
			<p> Then for task two we create a CSS file. In the CSS file there should be
			be the following:</p>
				<li> Style image so they are around 100 to 150 pixels wide</li>
				<li> Style all divs so they are 30% wide</li>
				<li> Style your floated div so it floats left or right</li>
				<li> Style your center-horz div so the text inside is centered</li>
				<li> Style your center-img div so your image is centered horizontally</li>
				<li> Style your center-both div so that the image is centered both vertically
						and horizontally</li>

			<div id="center-both">
				<img src="img/rocket.jpeg" alt="image">
			</div>

	<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p> I had a lot of challenges. I am not sure why when I add a border it cuts off
		at a certain spot. I tried looking it up but wasn't sure. I struggled a lot with this
	  lab, I will go to office hours to get help. I was harder since I didn't have a partner.
		This was the most challenging lab thus far.</p>

	<div id= "floated">
	<h2> Results</h2>
		<p> Not the best since I need a lot of help on how to do divs and properly set them in
		my CSS.</p>
