<h1> Fancy CSS prt.2</h1>

<h2> CHALLENGE </h2>
	<p>	The challenge for lab 16 is to continue to build on on the CSS rules from the
		previous lab and adding the following CSS rules:</p>
	<li> more backgrounds </li>
	<li> transitions (at least two examples of different transitions) </li>
	<li> animation </li>
	<li> columns </li>

<h2> PROBLEMS </h2>
	<p> The main problem I ran into was the transition part. I kept putting in my CSS how
		I wanted my image but it wouldn't do it. I tried doing the gradinet background w the gif I chose
		and having the gif sit in the background and it would just make the gif the whole background. Also
		animation was not working in my favor. I went on to w3schools and did it how it said to do input input
		it into my CSS and nothing happened.
	</p>

<h2> RESULTS </h2>
	<p> By inputing those rules into CSS I was able to get this as my webpage.</p>

<div id="content">
<img src="img/flowers.gif" alt="image"/>
</div>

<nav class=home-link>
			<a href="../index.html">Return to Homepage</a>
</nav>
</body>
