	<h1> Lab 14 Typography 2</h1>

<div id="content"
	<h2> Subject </h2>
	<p> In this lab we are still using block-level and typography css to recreate a more complicated webpage.
	  	It is the same concept as lab 13, just choosing a much harder you can say, website.</p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> This lab was still a little hard for me but I didn't feel so lost since the past lab. The two main challenges
			were the fonts once again. Trying to get the text to go over the text. I tried looking it up but nothing was working.
			The other challege was inputting the arrow. </p>
