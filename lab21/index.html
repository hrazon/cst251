			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p>The challenge for this lab was to take our ideas from our previous
					assignment, get feedback, and further develop a few of these ideas.
					We must work individually. Once we got the feedback we needed we had
					take the best tree ideas, and turn them into more developed sketches
					on paper. Include callouts if needed. Finally of course create an
					index.html, CSS file for this lab, and test, debug, and upload.</p>

			<h3>Problems</h3>
