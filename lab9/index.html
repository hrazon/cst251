		<h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
	<div id=text>
		<h2> Subject </h2>
		<p> We are still classifying codes from the two previous labs but with this lab
		we are coding these certain parts.</p>
		<li> Modifying the margins and padding of our content div</li>
		<li> Add a border</li>
		<li> Change the color of your body and your content div</li>
		<li> Style your image and adjust the height and width of your image</li>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> My challange for this lab was trying to set the image I have as my background.
		I kept looking on w3schools on how to do it but with the help of one of my classmates
		all I needed to do was to make sure in my lab.css was to make sure my image had "cover"
		if not it would repeat.

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> Messing around with the css and inspector, this is how my lab turned out.</p>
