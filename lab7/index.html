		<h2> Subject</h2>
		<p> This concept of this lab is to create an index page and style with your
			own CSS style sheet.</p>

		<h2> Summary and Difficulties</h2>
		<p>With this lab I learned A LOT of new things. I had always wondered how websites had different
		font sizes, fonts, color etc and all that fun stuff to make a website look more appealing. With this
		lab it gave me a clipse of that so that was really fun. Some difficulties I would say I had just making
		sure everything looked good in my local file. Having to constantly "save" and then "view in my browser"
		it was a little time consuming but for the most part everything seemed to be coming out good. I would
		just want to know if there are any other font-families? I went on to w3schools but not much was coming up
		unless I wasn't looking in the right place or not putting in the code in correctly. What also helped me was watching youtube
		videos people going through the process and seeing what they are doing.</p>

		<h2> Results</h2>
		This was a fun lab for me. It was fun getting to mess around with the background colors, fonts, borders,
		everything. Now my pages on my website won't look so boring.
