<h1> Lab 18: Responsive Design </h1>

<h2> CHALLENGE </h2>
	<p>	The challenge for this lab was to create a header, footer, nav, and main
		sections. Then styling out layout by using elements like flexbox, making sure
		at least two elements are side-by-side. Adding media query rules that make
		our side-by-side elements shift to 100% width when the viewpoint is smaller
		than 600px. Finally of course, test, debug and upload.</p>

<h2> PROBLEMS </h2>
	<p> I could not get the media query rule to work in CSS.</p>

<h2> RESULTS </h2>
	<p> By inputing those rules into CSS I was able to get this as my webpage.</p>

	<nav class= "links">
	  <h1> Links </h1>
	  <ul>
	  <li><a href="../index.html">Return to Homepage</a></li>
	  <li><a href="/cst251/lab17/float.html">Float HTML</a></li>
	  <li><a href="/cst251/lab17/flexbox.html">Flexbox HTML</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>

	<footer>
	  <p> school email: hrazon@csumb.edu </p>
	  <p> personal email: razonheaven@gmail.com</p>
	</footer>
