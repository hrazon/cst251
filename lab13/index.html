	</div>

	<h2> Subject </h2>
	<p> In this lab we are creating fake htmls and css's from a website of our choice.
	The onyl thing was we are not able to inspect the website. We just had to try and replicate
 	the first page we seen. BUT we were able to change things up but still keeping it with the theme
	of the website we had chosen.</p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> This lab had many challenges for me. I was not able to get the fake website of mine to
		sort of look like the website I had chose. I was having a pretty hard time with this whole label
		but I did try my best and used the knoweledge I already have to complete this task. As well as with
		the help of w3schools and youtube.
	</p>

	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> These are my results. Not the best work but I tried.
			The screenshot is what I was trying to "copy" and what is in the iframe is what I was able to do.</p>

	<div id="iframe">
			<img src="img/original_screenshot.jpg" width="800" height="500"/>
		<iframe id="fake" src="fake.html"></iframe>
