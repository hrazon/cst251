		<h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>
	<div id=text>

		<h2> Subject </h2>
		<p> We are still classifying codes from the three previous labs but with this lab
		we are coding these certain parts.</p>
		<li> Select a new font for your body text. Good web design suggests you keep in plain
		and readable</li>
		<li> Style your headings with color, text-transform, and letter-spacing</li>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> The only challenges I had encountered was changing the font color. I wanted a specific
			color for my headers, body text, etc and I could not figure that out. I finally did and I
			did not like how it looked so I kept it all one color expect my "list" area and my "Return to Homepage".
			I am still a little confused on how to change the font. I wrote a note stating in order to use a google
			font I just have to put a link to the font in the "head" of my HTML but don't know the proper way to do so.
		</p>

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> Messing around with the css and inspector, this is how my lab turned out.</p>
		<nav class=home-link>
				<a href="../index.html">Return to Homepage</a>
		</nav>
</body>
