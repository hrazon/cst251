	<h2> Subject </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this lab is to still utilize the CSS rules from previous
			labs and continue building on those. With an addition of adding a sidebar
			div and styling it the following:</p>
			<li> It is inline-block style</li>
			<li> Has a width of 1/3 of the page</li>
			<li> Has a minimum width of 300px</li>
			<li> Positioned to the right of the rest of the content</li>

	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The first challenge I encountered was not knowing where to change certain
		CSS rules but with the help of w3schools I figured it out. The last challenge
		was trying to figure out why some CSS rules were still appearing on my webpage
		when I would view it in my browser and were not in my lab 11 css. I then realized
		I had my CSS Homepage linked to my index.html so that's why they kept appearing.</p>

	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> All in all, I always enjoy labs like this because I learn different things
		and I always find out new tricks. So this is my website page :) </p>
