		<h1>Lab 8: CSS Slectors</h1>
	<div id=text>
		<h2> Subject</h2>
		<p>The concept of the lab is to create an index page and continue styling how we did with Lab 7 only difference
		is adding rules to style the following</p>
		<li>Style every element of a particular class</li>
		<li>Style particular type of element with a class name</li>
		<li>Style more than one element at a time</li>
		<li>Style an element within another element</li>
		<li>Style your image, so the size changes when you hover over it</li>

		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>The difficulties that I had ran to in the beginning was my html not working when I would open it in my browser.
		I thought that maybe it was because of the image I chose so I inserted an image that I had used before and nothing
	  popping up. From that point I just started checking my other htmls in my other labs everything was working. What I did
		was copy my whole html from the previous lab and tested it and it showed in my browser. So I just had to edit it from
		there to make it how I have it now. Another thing I am still having difficulties with is still understanding the lingo
		and how to type of certain codes in the css folder. Other than that it was a pretty easy lab.</p>

		<h2> Results</h2>
		<p>In conclusion, I really enjoyed messing around with all the diffferent styles, testing and seeing them in my browser.</p>
